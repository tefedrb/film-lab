## How to install
This project was created with `create-react-app`. Once you have the app forked and cloned, you should run `npm install`. You can then run it with `npm run start`. You'll need your own API-key from "The Movie Database API". Add it to the file titled TMDB.js by replacing "process.env.REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY" with your personal API-key.
